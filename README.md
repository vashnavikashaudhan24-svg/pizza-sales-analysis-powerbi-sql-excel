# Pizza-Sales-Data-Analysis (Interactive Dashboard creation using Power BI, SQL, MS Excel)
## Project Objective
The owner of the pizza store wants to create a comprehensive report that analyzes historical sales data (Jan 2015 - Dec 2015) to understand key performance drivers, identify the most and least profitable products, and determine optimal staffing/marketing periods based on daily and monthly trends, to drive future business growth and efficiency.
                     🍕 Pizza Sales Analysis: End-to-End Data Project

### 1. 🛠 Tools Used
  This project utilizes a robust three-tool pipeline for data analysis:
- SQL: Used for complex KPI calculation, deep analytical queries, and Top/Bottom analysis.
- Microsoft Excel: Used for initial data cleaning, transformation, and integrity checks.
- Power BI: Used for data modeling and creating the final interactive dashboard/report.

### 2. ✨ Features / Highlights
  This project features a comprehensive analysis covering several key business aspects:
- Core KPI Calculation: Precise calculation of Total Revenue, Average Order Value, Total Pizzas Sold, and more.
- Product Performance Analysis: Detailed Top-5/Bottom-5 analysis by Revenue, Quantity, and Total Orders.
- Time-Series Insights: Identification of daily, weekly, and monthly sales trends (e.g., busiest hours/days).
- Segmentation Analysis: Breakdown of sales by Pizza Category and Pizza Size.

### 3. 🎯 Business Problem
  The pizza store lacked a centralized, data-driven system to track its performance. Management needed a comprehensive report based on historical sales data (Jan 2015 – Dec 2015) to        answer critical questions such as:
- Which pizza varieties are underperforming or driving maximum profit?
- When are the peak sales hours and months for optimal staffing and inventory?
- What is the best-selling pizza size and category?

### 4. 🥅 Goal of Dashboard
  The primary goal was to transform raw sales data into actionable business intelligence. The dashboard aims to provide a single-view, interactive platform enabling stakeholders to:
- Monitor performance through core KPIs instantly.
- Identify high-growth opportunities and areas needing improvement (e.g., promotional campaigns for slow-moving items).
- Make data-backed decisions regarding inventory management and marketing schedules.

- Targeted Marketing: Sales peak on Fridays and Saturdays and during January/July. Marketing efforts should be prioritized during these periods.
- Inventory Focus: The Classic category and Large size pizzas contribute the most to sales, ensuring adequate stock for these items is critical.
- Actionable Strategy: The Brie Carre Pizza, identified as the lowest revenue generator, requires a clear promotional or price review strategy.
